# theme_swithers
## In this repository you can find theme switchers with multiple themes using HTML, CSS(SCSS) and JS
### Here are two variants of this project
- First one uses css classes [Here](https://bawelna0225.github.io/theme_swithers/using_css_classes/index.html)
- Second one uses data stored in JSON file [Here](https://bawelna0225.github.io/theme_swithers/using_json_file/index.html)
#### Both use localStorage to save user preference
